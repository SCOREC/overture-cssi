This is the main directory for the cg solvers. 


  common : files common to different solvers
  ins    : incompressible flow solver
  cns    : compressible flow solver
  ad     : advection-diffusion (and heat equation) solver
  mp     : multiphysics solver (which uses the other solvers)
  mx     : solver for Maxwell's equations
  sm     : solid mechanics solver 

To build the incompressible flow solver, for example, goto the ins directory and type make.



Build System
------------

  The build system for cg uses configuration information from Overture. You will need to set
the environmental variables as required for Overture. In addition you should specify the
following environment variables:

    CG : location of the cg files, e.g.
         setenv CG /home/henshaw/cg
    LAPACK : location of the Lapack libraries, e.g.
         setenv LAPACK /usr/local/lib


To compile all cg modules type:
    make
To only compile a single module, e.g. cgcns, go to that directory and type make:
   cd cgcns
   make


Compiling multiple versions from a single source tree
-----------------------------------------------------

Suppose the source files for cg are in /home/henshaw/cg. By default, typing
make in this directory will compile the files and build the executables
within this same directory. Now suppose you want to build a second version
(say the parallel version). Rather than copying all the source files to
a new directory one can instead set the  environment variable CGBUILDPREFIX as in

       setenv CGBUILDPREFIX /home/henshaw/cgp 

to specify the top level directory for the cg object files and executables.  In
this way you can have a single source tree (e.g. /home/henshaw/cg) with multiple
build trees. Now if you type "make" in the source tree, /home/henshaw/cg, the
object files and executables will be built in the CGBUILDPREFIX directory.


Compiling with PETSc
--------------------

You may optionally use PETSc to solve linear systems. In this case you should install PETSc and
set the PETSc enviromental variables (following the PETSc instructions): 
    PETSC_DIR
    PETSC_ARCH

You then need to edit the appropriate cg Makefile such as ins/Makefile and set the usePETSc variable to on: 
    usePETSc   := on


Build organization:
-------------------

Here is an example of one of the Makefile's :

    ins/Makefile :
       -> includes ../config/make.$(OS) : defines compiler flags (CXX_FLAGS_DBG)
          -> includes $(Overture)/make.options  : define compilers (CXX,FC), libraries (HDF,Motif), etc. 
       -> includes ../config/make.rules : defines implicit rules, .C -> .o etc.
       -> includes ../config/make.options : defines flags for compile=opt/debug
       -> includes make: adds to INCLUDES, LIBS (defined in ../common/make)
          -> includes ../common/make  : defines common include paths (INCLUDES), libraries (LIBS,FLIBS)
       -> includes src/files : the list of ins src files to compile
