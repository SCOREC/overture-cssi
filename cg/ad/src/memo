--- CHAMP FILES FROM SIJIA ---

cg3:

     champBoundaryConditions.bC 
     champ2InterfaceCartesian.C
     champ2MappedInterfaceStencil.C


Hi Dr.Henshaw,

My code is under the directory 
/home/16/huangs6/overtureFramework/cg/ad/src/ called 
champ2InterfaceCartesian.C for the rectangular grid and 
champ2MappedInterfaceStencil.C for the curvilinear grid. I added two 
includes statements in the champBoundaryConditions.bC along with many 
printF statements. Under /home/16/huangs6/runs/ad/tz there is a memo 
file that records all the results of my matrix computation.

For the Cartesian grid when bc3 and bc4 is 1 not only the dx and dy need 
to be flipped, but also the CHAMP condition is a little bit different. 
You could look at my old file called champ2InterfaceStencil.C under the 
directory /home/16/huangs6/overtureFramework/cg/ad/src/ for the case 
axis!=0. I have written out the CHAMP condition for that case explicitly 
in that file.

Let me know if there is anything else you need.

Best,
Sijia
