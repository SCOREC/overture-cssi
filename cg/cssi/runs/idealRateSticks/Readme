Detonation propagating through a "rate stick".

These examples appear in the paper:
"A Study of Detonation Propagation and Diffraction with Compliant Confinement",
by J.W. Banks,  W. D. Henshaw, D.W. Schwendeman and A.K. Kapila,

Generate the grid:
  ogen -noplot stickGrid.cmd

Strong confinement case: (this fine grid computation takes about 12 hours to run)

   1. Run:
      cgcns -noplot runStrongStick.cmd >! strongShock.out 
   2. Plot results:
      plotStuff strongStick320.show

Weak confinement case: (this fine grid computation takes about 12 hours to run)

   1. Run:
     cgcns -noplot runWeakStick.cmd >! runWeakStick.out
   2. Plot results:
     plotStuff weakStick320.show
