cg.v25

 o 2011/06/19 - added simulate grid motion to cgcssi.
 o 2011/08/18 - the calling sequence to userDefinedBoundary values has been changed.
 o 2011/08/18 - new body forcing options ... finish me ...
 o 2011/10/29 - some new variable material properties capabilities have been added:
             cgsm : variable rho, mu and lambda (so far for 2D SOSC scheme)
             cgins: variable rho, Cp, and thermalConductivity for incompressible Boussinesq.
 o 2011/11/07 - fixed the CPU timings that are output when running Cgmp. 
 o 2011/11/09 - added a userDefinedInitialCondition.C file to cg/sm/src for use with cgsm.
 o 2011/12/18 - it is now possible to change the properties of moving bodies (rigid bodies and
                matrix motion bodies) from the run time menu button "moving grid options...". 
                This can be used, for e.g. to change the motion of a body after a moving grid
                solution has been read from a restart file, or at any time during a simulation.
 o 2012/03/01 - the normal component of the velocity can now be specified at inflow using the
                userDefinedBoundaryData option "normal component of velocity" (see e.g. in cg/ins/cmd/cic.cmd)
 o 2012/07/22 - the BC inflowWithPressureAndTangentialVelocityGiven now works in parallel for
                second-order accuracy.

cg.v24 - released May 2011. 

Changes:

   o a new "matrix motion" option has been added for moving grids which can be used to compose together
     different rotations and translations to form more complex motions. See the new document matrixMotion.pdf
     for more details. The test routine cg/user/bin/motion can be used to test different matrix motions. 

   o it is now possible to solve for the motion of "light" rigid bodies moving in a fluid (cgins). The
     default time-stepping algorithm is unstable when the bodies are too light. The new algorithm requires
     extra correction steps. See the ?? documentation for further details and examples.

cg.v23 -- released March 13, 2009

Changes:

  
   o userDefinedMotion.C : the object params has been renamed to parameters. 
   o userDefinedBoundaryValues.C : the getBoundaryData(..) functions are now in parameters.getBoundaryData(...)
   o There is now an option to save solution values over time at specified points using "probes". This information
     is written to a text file that can be plotted with the matlab script plotProbes.m 
   o There have been many changes to cgmp. There now many examples of conjugate heat transfer problems that
     couple fluid flows and heat transfer.
   o The solid mechanics solver cgsm is starting to acquire some capabilities.
