/// \mainpage CG: A Suite of Composite Grid PDE Solvers - Source Code Documentation 
///  
/// 
///  \section intro_sec Introduction
///     This document contains the CG source code documentation. 
///   CG is a suite of partial differential equation (PDE) solvers for composite overlapping grids.
///   CG is built upon the Overture software framework. CG is written in C++ at the high level and uses
///   Fortran kernels.  
///
///  \section summary_sec Available PDE Solvers
///    Here is a summary of the various solvers in the CG suite. 
///
///      - Cgad : advection diffusion solver.  
///      - Cgasf : all-speed flow solver (not mature).
///      - Cgcssi : compressible flow solver.
///      - Cgins : incompressible flow solver.
///      - Cgsm : solid mechanics solver.
///      - Cgmx (Maxwell) : Maxwell's equation solver (electro-magnetics).
///      - Cgmp : multi-physics, multi-domain solver.
