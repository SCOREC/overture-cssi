\subsection{Detonation hitting multiple rigid bodies}\label{sec:detMultiCyl}

To run this example see {\tt cg/cssi/runs/multiCylOneStep/Readme}.

A detonation moving from left to right impacts a collection of cylinders.
The initial conditions for this computation are determined in the matlab script {\tt cg/cgcssi/runs/multiCylOneStep/profile.m}.
This script computes the steady ZND profile for a one-dimensional detonation for various equations of state.
% The fluid
% forces cause the cylinders to move. The cylinders are modeled as rigid bodies with a given mass density.
% A complex pattern of reflected and transmitted shocks results. Eventually some semblence of the 
% incident shock appears to the right of the cylinders. 
% This computation illustrates the use of moving grids and AMR. Collision
% detection has been turned on.
