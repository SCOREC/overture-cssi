 Here is a desciption of the menu options available for changing parameters. This main parameter menu appears
 when \OverBlown is run and is found in the {\tt OverBlown::\-set\-Parameters\-Interactively()} function.
\begin{description}
  \item[continue] choose this item to exit this menu and continue on to the run-time dialog.
  \item[time stepping parameters...] : open the time stepping parameters dialog
    \begin{description}
      \item[time stepping method] : Not all schemes work for all PDEs. 
        \begin{description}
          \item[forwardEuler] : For CSSI Godunov
          \item[adamsBashforth2] : For INS.
          \item[adamsPredictorCorrector2] : For INS.
          \item[variableTimeStepAdamsPredictorCorrector] for CSSI.
          \item[midpoint] : For INS.
          \item[implicit] : For INS. Treat the viscous terms implicitly. One may optinally specify that some
             grids are integrated explicitly and some implicitly (see {\tt choose grids for implicit}).
          \item[all speed implicit] : For All-speed-flow.
          \item[linearized all speed implicit] :  For All-speed-flow. Linearize the implicit equations so that
             the implicit matrix is only formed and factored every ?? steps.
        \end{description}
      \item[final time] : Integrate to this time.
      \item[cfl] : Set the {\tt cfl} parameter. 
         The maximum time step based on stability is scaled by this factor.
         By default {\tt cfl=.9}. 
      \item[dtMax] : Restrict the time step to be no larger than this value.
      \item[implicit factor] :This value in $[0.,1.]$ is used with the implicit time-stepping. A value
         of $.5$ will correspond to a 2nd-order Crank-Nicolson approach for the viscous terms,
        a value of $1.$ will be backward-Euler and a value of $0.$ will be forward-Euler. See 
        the the reference manual for more details.
      \item[recompute dt every] : The time step, dt,  is recomputed every time the solution is plotted/saved.
              In addition you may specify the maximum number of steps that will be taken
              before dt is recomputed. Use this if the solution is not plotted very often.
      \item[slow start time] : Ramp the time step $\Delta t$ from a small value (determined by slow start cfl)
         to it maximum value (as  determined by the {\tt cfl} parameter over this time interval. 
      \item[slow start cfl]: The initial time step for the slow start option is determined by this cfl value, default$=.25$..
    \end{description}
  
 \item[pde options...] open the pde options menu. The dialog which opens depends on which PDE was chosen and is described below.
 \item[initial conditions options...] open the initial conditions dialog. This dialog is under
      construction.
    \begin{description}
      \item[read from a show file]: read initial conditions from a show file. This can either be
        a show file generated from OverBlown or one that you have built yourself.
      \item[read from a restart file]: read initial conditions from a restart file.  
      \item[uniform state] : specify a uniform state.

    \begin{description}
        \item[show variables] : toggle on/off variables that should be saved in the show file.
        \item[mode] : specify the mode as compressed or uncompressed. A compressed file will be
         smaller (especially for AMR runs that create many grids) but a compressed file will not
         be readable by future versions of OverBlown. 
        \item[open] : open a show file. You will be prompted for the name.
        \item[close] : close the show file.
      \item[frequency to save] : By default the solution is saved in the show file
          as often as it is plotted according to {\tt 'times to plot'}. To save the solution less
          often set this integer value to be greater than 1. A value of 2 for example will save solutions
          every 2nd time the solution is plotted.
      \item[frequency to flush] : Save this many solutions in each show file so that multiple
        show files will be created (these are automatically handled by plotStuff). See section~(\ref{sec:flush})
        for why you might do this.  
     \end{description}

        \end{description}
      \item[output periodically to a file] : output data to a file at each time step
      \item[times to plot] : Specify the time interval between plotting (and saving in a show file).

                specified here. 
         \end{description}
      \end{description}

    \begin{description}
      \item[choose grids for implicit] : For use with the {\tt implicit} time stepping option. Choose 
         which grids to integrate implicitly and which to integrate explicitly. Normally one should choose
         thoses grids with fine grid spacing (such as in boundary layers) to be implicit while a back-ground
       grid could be explicit. See section~(\ref{sec:implicitMenu}).
    \end{description}

        \end{description}
      \item[debug (debug=)] : This is a bit flag that turns on various messages. The more bits turned
        on, the more detailed the messages that appear. Thus a value of debug=3 (1+2) would have the first
        2 bits turned on and would display few messages. A value of debug=63 (1+2+4+8+16+32) would have 6
        bits turned on and would results in a lot of information.
      \item[Oges::debug (od=)] : bit flag debug variable for Oges.
      \item[Reactions::debug (rd=)] :
      \item[compare 3D run to 2D] : this option will adjust the equations and forcing so
         that a 3D run on an extruded 2D grid can be compared to the 2D computation. This includes setting
         the twilight-zone function to be 2D and changing the divergence damping (INS) to be two-dimensional 
         (otherwise it is scaled in the wrong way).
    \end{description}
  \item[reduce interpolation width] : specify a new interpolation width. For example, when solving the
      inviscid Navier-Stokes equations one may want to use linear interpolation (width=2) instead of
      of quadratic interpolation (width=3) since this may reduce wiggles. 
      If the grid was built with width=3 interpolation you can
      reduce the order of interpolation with this option.
  \item[sparse solver options] :
    \begin{description}
      \item[pressure solver options] : Choosing this item will allow you to change any {\tt Oges} related

         parameters as they apply to the mplicit time stepping equations. See the {\tt Oges} documentation
         for a description of these parameters~\cite{OGES}.
    \end{description}
  \item[moving grids] : Options related to moving grids.
    \begin{description}
      \item[turn on moving grids] : Allow grids to move.
      \item[turn off moving grids] : do not allow grids to move.
      \item[specify grids to move] : indicate which grids move and how. You must also choose 
            {\tt`turn on moving grids'} if you really want these grids to move. See section~(\ref{sec:moveMenu}).
      \item[detect collisions] : detect collisions for some types of rigid bodies (wip)
      \item[do not detect collisions] : turn off collision detection.
      \item[minimum separation for collisions] : minimum allowed distance between colliding bodies. 
          This distance is in grid lines and should be chosen large enough so that a valid grid
          can still be generated. Usually value will be from 2 to 3 but may need to be more for
          some grids.
    \end{description}
  \item[plot the grid] : plot the grid. Useful to see if boundary conditions have been plotted correctly.
  \item[erase] : erase the graphics screen.
  \item[exit] : exit this menu and continue on (same as 'continue').
