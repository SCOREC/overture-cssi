abstract = "An efficient and accurate finite-element algorithm is described for the numerical solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes (INS) equations. The new algorithm that solves the INS equations in a velocity-pressure reformulation is based on a split-step scheme in conjunction with the standard finite-element method. The split-step scheme employed for the temporal discretization of our algorithm completely separates the pressure updates from the solution of velocity variables. When the pressure equation is formed explicitly, the algorithm avoids solving a saddle-point problem; therefore, our algorithm has more flexibility in choosing finite-element spaces. In contrast, popular mixed finite-element methods that solve the INS equations in the primitive variables (or velocity-divergence formulation) lead to discrete saddle-point problems whose solution depends on the choice of finite-element spaces for velocity and pressure that is subject to the well-known Ladyzenskaja-Babuška-Brezzi (LBB) (or inf-sup) condition. For efficiency and robustness, Lagrange (piecewise-polynomial) finite elements of equal order for both velocity and pressure are used. Accurate numerical boundary condition for the pressure equation is also investigated. Motivated by a post-processing technique that calculates derivatives of a finite element solution with super-convergent error estimates, an alternative numerical boundary condition is proposed for the pressure equation at the discrete level. The new numerical pressure boundary condition that can be regarded as a better implementation of the compatibility boundary condition improves the boundary-layer errors of the pressure solution. A normal-mode analysis is performed using a simplified model problem on a uniform mesh to demonstrate the numerical properties of our methods. Convergence studies using P1 elements support the analytical results and demonstrates that our algorithm with the new numerical boundary condition achieves the optimal second-order accuracy for both velocity and pressure up-to the boundary. Benchmark problems are also computed and carefully compared with existing studies. Finally, as an example to illustrate that our approach can be easily adapted for higher-order finite elements, we solve the classical flow-past-a-cylinder problem using Pn finite elements with n≥1."

Phys. 182 (1) (2002) 191–212] and consider its application to linear hyperbolic systems. The super-grid-scale model consists of two parts: reduction of an unbounded to a bounded domain by a smooth coordinate transformation and a damping of those scales. For linear problems the super-grid scales are analogous to spurious numerical waves. We damp these waves by high-order undivided differences. We compute reflection coefficients for different orders of the damping and find that significant improvements are obtained when high-order damping is used. In numerical experiments with Maxwell’s equations, we show that when the damping is of high order, the error from the boundary condition converges at the order of the interior scheme. We also demonstrate that the new method achieves perfectly matched layer-like accuracy. When applied to linear hyperbolic systems the stability of the super-grid-scale method follows from its construction. This makes our method particularly suitable for problems for which perfectly matched layers are unstable. We present results for two such problems: elastic waves in anisotropic media and isotropic elastic waves in wave guides with traction-free surfaces."

We prove several optimal a priori error estimates in space-time norms for this new method and show that it can be more efficient than existing methods. We also write the leading term of the local discretization error in terms of Lobatto polynomials in space and Jacobi polynomials in time which leads to superconvergence points on each space-time cell. We discuss how to apply our results to construct efficient and asymptotically exact a posteriori estimates for space-time discretization errors. Numerical results are in agreement with theory."

abstract = "We present an iterative semi-implicit scheme for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, which is stable at \{CFL\} numbers well above the nominal limit. We have implemented this scheme in conjunction with spectral discretizations, which suffer from serious time step limitations at very high resolution. However, the approach we present is general and can be adopted with finite element and finite difference discretizations as well. Specifically, at each time level, the nonlinear convective term and the pressure boundary condition – both of which are treated explicitly in time – are updated using fixed-point iteration and Aitken relaxation. Eigenvalue analysis shows that this scheme is unconditionally stable for Stokes flows while numerical results suggest that the same is true for steady Navier–Stokes flows as well. This finding is also supported by error analysis that leads to the proper value of the relaxation parameter as a function of the flow parameters. In unsteady flows, second- and third-order temporal accuracy is obtained for the velocity field at \{CFL\} number 5–14 using analytical solutions. Systematic accuracy, stability, and cost comparisons are presented against the standard semi-implicit method and a recently proposed fully-implicit scheme that does not require Newton’s iterations. In addition to its enhanced accuracy and stability, the proposed method requires the solution of symmetric only linear systems for which very effective preconditioners exist unlike the fully-implicit schemes.

abstract = "In this article we discuss a methodology that allows the direct numerical simulation of incompressible viscous fluid flow past moving rigid bodies. The simulation methods rest essentially on the combination of: (a) Lagrange-multiplier-based fictitious domain methods which allow the fluid flow computations to be done in a fixed flow region. (b) Finite element approximations of the Navier–Stokes equations occurring in the global model. (c) Time discretizations by operator splitting schemes in order to treat optimally the various operators present in the model. The above methodology is particularly well suited to the direct numerical simulation of particulate flow, such as the flow of mixtures of rigid solid particles and incompressible viscous fluids, possibly non-Newtonian. We conclude this article with the presentation of the results of various numerical experiments, including the simulation of store separation for rigid airfoils and of sedimentation and fluidization phenomena in two and three dimensions.

For each class of schemes, theoretical and numerical convergence results available in the literature are reviewed and open questions are discussed.

abstract = "This paper presents a numerical scheme for riser motion calculation and its application to riser \{VIV\} simulations. The discretisation of the governing differential equation is studied first. The top tensioned risers are simplified as tensioned beams. A centered space and forward time finite difference scheme is derived from the governing equations of motion. Then an implicit method is adopted for better numerical stability. The method meets von Neumann criteria and is shown to be unconditionally stable. The discretized linear algebraic equations are solved using a \{LU\} decomposition method. This approach is then applied to a series of benchmark cases with known solutions. The comparisons show good agreement. Finally the method is applied to practical riser \{VIV\} simulations. The studied cases cover a wide range of riser \{VIV\} problems, i.e. different riser outer diameter, length, tensioning conditions, and current profiles. Reasonable agreement is obtained between the numerical simulations and experimental data on riser motions and cross-flow \{VIV\} a/D. These validations and comparisons confirm that the present numerical scheme for riser motion calculation is valid and effective for long riser \{VIV\} simulation. "

abstract = "We present numerical schemes for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations based on a primitive variable formulation in which the incompressibility constraint has been replaced by a pressure Poisson equation. The pressure is treated explicitly in time, completely decoupling the computation of the momentum and kinematic equations. The result is a class of extremely efficient Navier–Stokes solvers. Full time accuracy is achieved for all flow variables. The key to the schemes is a Neumann boundary condition for the pressure Poisson equation which enforces the incompressibility condition for the velocity field. Irrespective of explicit or implicit time discretization of the viscous term in the momentum equation the explicit time discretization of the pressure term does not affect the time step constraint. Indeed, we prove unconditional stability of the new formulation for the Stokes equation with explicit treatment of the pressure term and first or second order implicit treatment of the viscous term. Systematic numerical experiments for the full Navier–Stokes equations indicate that a second order implicit time discretization of the viscous term, with the pressure and convective terms treated explicitly, is stable under the standard \{CFL\} condition. Additionally, various numerical examples are presented, including both implicit and explicit time discretizations, using spectral and finite difference spatial discretizations, demonstrating the accuracy, flexibility and efficiency of this class of schemes. In particular, a Galerkin formulation is presented requiring only \{C0\} elements to implement. "

Based on an interesting model for malleable tasks with continuous processor allotments by Prasanna and Musicus (1991, 1994, 1996) [23\u201325], we define two natural assumptions for malleable tasks: the processing time of any malleable task is non-increasing in the number of processors allotted, and the speedup is concave in the number of processors. We show that under these assumptions the work function of any malleable task is non-decreasing in the number of processors and is convex in the processing time. Furthermore, we propose a two-phase approximation algorithm for the scheduling problem. In the first phase we solve a linear program to obtain a fractional allotment for all tasks. By rounding the fractional solution, each malleable task is assigned a number of processors. In the second phase a variant of the list scheduling algorithm is employed. By choosing appropriate values of the parameters, we show (via a nonlinear program) that the approximation ratio of our algorithm is at most 100 / 63 + 100 ( 6469 + 13 ) / 5481 \u2248 3.291919 . We also show that our result is asymptotically tight."

abstract = "How to properly specify boundary conditions for pressure is a longstanding problem for the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations with no-slip boundary conditions. An analytical resolution of this issue stems from a recently developed formula for the pressure in terms of the commutator of the Laplacian and Leray projection operators. Here we make use of this formula to (a) improve the accuracy of computing pressure in two kinds of existing time-discrete projection methods implicit in viscosity only, and (b) devise new higher-order accurate time-discrete projection methods that extend a slip-correction idea behind the well-known finite-difference scheme of Kim and Moin. We test these schemes for stability and accuracy using various combinations of C 0 finite elements. For all three kinds of time discretization, one can obtain third-order accuracy for both pressure and velocity without a time-step stability restriction of diffusive type. Furthermore, two kinds of projection methods are found stable using piecewise-linear elements for both velocity and pressure. "

In this note, we present a survey of balancing related model reduction methods and their corresponding error norms, and also introduce some new results. Five balancing methods are studied: (1) Lyapunov balancing, (2) stochastic balancing, (3) bounded real balancing, (4) positive real balancing and (5) frequency weighted balancing. For positive real balancing, we introduce a multiplicative-type error bound. Moreover, for a certain subclass of positive real systems, a modified positive-real balancing scheme with an absolute error bound is proposed. We also develop a new frequency-weighted balanced reduction method with a simple bound on the error system based on the frequency domain representations of the system gramians. Two numerical examples are illustrated to verify the efficiency of the proposed methods.",

Compared with body-fitted meshes, the biggest advantage of Cartesian grids is that the grid generation is trivial. The challenge is, however, that the physical boundary does not usually coincide with grid lines. The wide stencil of the high-order interior scheme makes a stable boundary treatment even harder to realize. There are two main ingredients of this method. The first one is an inverse Lax–Wendroff procedure for inflow boundary conditions and the other one is a robust and high-order accurate extrapolation for outflow boundary conditions. This method is high-order accurate, stable, and easy to implement. It has been successfully applied to simulate interactions between compressible inviscid flows and rigid (static or moving) bodies with complex geometry."

abstract = "We develop a high order finite difference numerical boundary condition for solving hyperbolic conservation laws on a Cartesian mesh. The challenge results from the wide stencil of the interior high order scheme and the fact that the boundary intersects the grids in an arbitrary fashion. Our method is based on an inverse Lax-Wendroff procedure for the inflow boundary conditions. We repeatedly use the partial differential equation to write the normal derivatives to the inflow boundary in terms of the time derivatives and the tangential derivatives. With these normal derivatives, we can then impose accurate values of ghost points near the boundary by a Taylor expansion. At outflow boundaries, we use Lagrange extrapolation or least squares extrapolation if the solution is smooth, or a weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) type extrapolation if a shock is close to the boundary. Extensive numerical examples are provided to illustrate that our method is high order accurate and has good performance when applied to one and two-dimensional scalar or system cases with the physical boundary not aligned with the grids and with various boundary conditions including the solid wall boundary condition. Additional numerical cost due to our boundary treatment is discussed in some of the examples."

abstract = "The main purpose of the research described in this paper is to investigate the hydroelastic interactions that take place between oscillating flexible cylinders and fluid forces. The cylinders are subject to currents and shear flow, and the hydrodynamic forces are estimated by a discrete vortex method. The calculations are compared with results obtained using the quasi-steady theory, as proposed by Bearman et al. (Appl. Ocean Res. 6(3) (1984) 166) and employed by Ferrari (Ph.D. Thesis, University of London, UK, 1998). In addition, the calculations are compared with experiments carried out by Fujarra (M.Sc. Thesis, Universidade de São Paulo, 1997) involving a cantilever flexible cylinder immersed in a current. The normalized amplitude curve obtained in the calculations is compared with the experimental results. Visualizations of the wake indicate a hybrid mode of vortex shedding along the span. Employing the terminology suggested by Williamson and Roshko (J. Fluids Struct. 2 (1988) 355), a 2S mode is found in regions of low amplitudes, changing to a 2P mode in regions of larger amplitudes. The position where transition of modes occurs varies with the reduced velocity. A practical case of a vertical marine riser is shown, and the numerical results for various current profiles are discussed. "
