\section{Introduction}

This is a primer for writing C++ codes to solve partial
differential equations (PDEs) within the Overture framework. 
The first set of examples describe how to use Overture to solve
problems on a single curvilinear grid. Overture classes are used
to represent the grid, to represent the solution on the grid, to operate
on the solution (differentiate, for example) and to plot the results.

The second set of examples show how to solve problems on overlapping grids.
These examples are very similiar to the single grid case.

The reader is assumed to be familiar with the A++ (parallel) array
class library~\cite{A++}. For the reader wanting to solve problems
on overlapping grids, some familiarity with the concept of an overlapping grid
is assumed.


In this primer we will introduce and show how to use the following
classes
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Mapping} : A transformation that can be used to represent a curvilinear domain
    such as a square, annulus, sphere or other more complicated region.
\item {\bf MappedGrid} : A logically rectangular grid that is a discrete version of a {\tt Mapping}.
  A MappedGrid contains grid point coordinates as well as information such as
  boundary conditions, periodicity, singularities etc.
\item {\bf realMappedGridFunction} : A grid function that holds a solution (such as pressure 
   or velocity) on a MappedGrid;  this is a glorified A++ array. 
\item {\bf \MGO~} : the class used with grid functions to define spatial derivatives
    and to apply boundary conditions.
\item {\bf PlotStuff} The class used to interactively plot Overture objects.
\item {\bf Ogshow} : A class for saving solutions and other information in a ``show file''.
    A show file can be read by plotStuff (in the Overture/bin directory) to plot solutions.
\item {\bf Oges} : The equation solver class that can be used to 
    solve systems of boundary value problems such as Poisson's equation.
\item {\bf CompositeGrid} : An ``overlapping composite grid''.
Each component grid of a CompositeGrid is a MappedGrid.
The grid generator {\tt Ogen}, for example, can generate a CompositeGrid.
\item {\bf realCompositeGridFunction} : A grid function that holds a solution
(such as the pressure or velocity) on a CompositeGrid.
\item {\bf \CGO~} : classes used with grid collection functions to define spatial derivatives
    and to apply boundary conditions.
\item {\bf Ogen} : The overlapping grid generator that can be used in a moving grid computation
    to regenerate an overlapping
    grid when one or more of the component grids change. The grid generator can also be run
    interactively to create an overlapping grid. See the documentation elsewhere.
\end{itemize}
These classes are collectively known as ``Overture''. ``Overture'' is an acronym
that has absolutely no meaning.

up Overture.

\section{Getting Started with MappedGrid's}

\subsection{mappedGridExample1: Mapping's, MappedGrid's, MappedGridFunction's}\index{mappedGridExample1}
\index{MappedGrid!example}
\index{MappedGridFunction!example}
\index{MappedOperators!example}

In this first example we introduce the classes that are used to represent domains ({\tt Mapping}),
grids ({\tt MappedGrid}) and and grid functions ({\tt realMappedGridFunction})
(a grid function is the Overture name for a solution variable or a field variable).

In this example the {\tt SquareMapping} is created to define the simple domain that is a square.
A {\tt MappedGrid} is created from the {\tt SquareMapping}, the {\tt MappedGrid} is a discrete
version of the {\tt Mapping} since it has a specified number of grid points.
To define a solution variable on the grid we build a {\tt realMappedGridFunction}. This is an
A++ array that is automatically dimensioned to the size of the grid.
The grid function is assigned values using array operations (instead of looping over
all the grid points, which could also be done). 

The {\tt MappedGridOperator} class is used to differentiate the grid function and the 
{\tt PlotStuff} class is used to interactively display the grid and the grid function.

\noindent {\bf Notes when you run the code:}
\begin{itemize}
 \item After some information is printed, a PlotStuff window should appear.
 \item Use the right mouse button to show the popup menu.
 \item After choosing the {\tt contour} menu item, a contour plot will appear and you will 
     be in the contour plotter with the contour popup menu.
     The contour is actually a surface which can be seen by rotating the view
     by clicking, with the left mouse buttom on one of the {\tt x-r}, {\tt x+r}, {\tt y-r}, ... buttons.
 \item Now choose {\tt erase and exit} to return to the previous menu.
 \item Use the left mouse button to look at the {\tt file} pull-down menu (in the upper left corner).
  Here is the command to save a postscript file.
   Answers to commands, such as the file name for the postscript file
   are typed on the {\tt Command:} line at the bottom. Any current menu item may also be optionally
   typed on the command line (one need only type at least as many letters in the name as to distinguish it).

\subsection{mappedGridExample2: Solve a PDE on an Annulus using operators}\index{mappedGridExample2}
\index{PDE!solve on a MappedGrid}

In this second example we put together all the classes that were introduced
in the first example to solve a simple PDE, a convection diffusion equation:
\begin{align*}
    u_t + a u_x + b u_y & = \nu( u_{xx} + u_{yy} ), \\
        u(x,y,0) & = 1    \qquad \text{(initial conditions)}, \\
        u(x,y,t) & = 0    \qquad \text{on the boundary}.
\end{align*}

An {\tt AnnulusMapping} is used to create an annulus on which to solve the PDE.

The {\tt MappedGridOperator} class is used to apply boundary conditions, in this
case a simple Dirichlet boundary condition (i.e. $u=0$ given on the boundary).
Many other boundary conditions are available.

\noindent {\bf Notes when you run the code:}
\begin{itemize}
 \item The solution will be plotted every 10 steps. 
 \item Choose the {\tt erase and exit} menu item from the popup menu to continue another 10 steps.
 \item you can rotate the view (left mouse button click on {\tt x-r} a couple of times) to 
       see the solution surface.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{mappedGridExample3:  Solve a PDE on an Annulus, explicit BC's, use NameList input}\index{mappedGridExample3}
\index{PDE!solve on a MappedGrid with explicit boundary conditions.}
\index{boundary conditions!explicit application}

In this example we make some minor changes to the previous PDE solver. 
The {\tt NameList} class is used to interactively enter parameter values by name. This is useful
if there are many parameters and only a few need to be changed. The NameList class is described
in the PlotStuff documentation.

Boundary conditions are assigned explicitly just to demonstrate how this is done. Using the
operators to apply boundary conditions is easier but there may be cases when the predefined
boundary conditions don't do what you want to do.




\noindent {\bf Notes when you run the code:}
\begin{itemize}
 \item When prompted for changes to the parameters you can type ``numberOfTimeSteps=100''
   (or ``nts=100'') to change the parameter {\tt numberOfTimeSteps}. Type ``exit'' to 
   continue.
 \item A contour plot of the initial conditions should appear. Choose ``exit'' from 
      the popup menu (right mouse button) and the solution will be automatically displayed
      every 5 time steps (``movie mode'').
\end{itemize}

\subsection{mappedGridExample5: Generate exact solutions in the Twilight Zone}\index{mappedGridExample5}
\index{twilight zone!example}

In this example we show how to use the {\bf method of analytic solutions} to generate
an exact solution to a PDE (the so-called twilight-zone solution). 
Given a PDE that we want to solve, such as,
\begin{align*}
    u_t + a u_x + b u_y & = \nu( u_{xx} + u_{yy} ) + f(x,y,t), \\
        u(x,y,t) & = g(x,y,t)    \qquad \text{on the boundary},
\end{align*}
we can choose the forcing function $f(x,y,t)$ and boundary condition $g(x,y,t)$
so that the solution is known. Suppose
that we want the solution to be the known function $U(x,y,t)$. For example $U$ may
be the polynomial
\[
 U=(1+x+x^2)(1+y+y^2)(1+t+t^2).
\]
By choosing
\begin{align*}
   f(x,y,t) & = U_t + a U_x + b U_y - \nu( U_{xx} + U_{yy} ) \\
   g(x,y,t) &= U(x,y,t)
\end{align*}
the exact solution for $u(x,y,t)$ will then be $U(x,y,t)$.
 
The classes {\tt OGPolyFunction} and {\tt OGTrigFunction} have been written to define
polynomial and trigonometric functions and their derivatives that can be used to define
the known function $U(x,y,z,t)$.

The boundary conditions defined in the operators have been written to optionally use
this method of analytic solutions. The operators need to be given the appropriate
true solution and they need to be told to force the boundary conditions as shown
in the example code below.

When using the polynomial exact solution (default) in the example below
the errors in the computed solution are `zero' (to roundoff, $2\times 10^{-7}$ in IEEE single precision).

When using the trigonometric exact solution (by choosing ``f=2'') the errors at time $t=.5$
are  $3.9\times 10^{-3}$ in IEEE single precision.

\subsection{mappedGridExample6: Time Step determination}\index{mappedGridExample6}
\index{time step determination!example}

In this example we demonstrate how the time step can be accurately determined
for a convection diffusion equation
\[
    u_t + a u_x + b u_y = \nu( u_{xx} + u_{yy} )
\]
The function that determines the time step is in 
file {\tt Overture/primer/getDt.C} while the file {\tt Overture/\-primer/\-mappedGridExample6.C}
uses this function. See the document {\it Time Step Determination for PDEs with Applications
to Programs Written with Overture} \cite{TIMESTEP} (available from the
Overture home page) for further details.

\subsection{Example: Steady state, linearized, incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations}
\index{PDE!steady incompressible Navier-Stokes}
\index{coefficient matrix!system example}

This example shows how to solve a system of equations that looks something like
the steady state incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The system we solve is
\begin{align*}
  \nu \Delta u -( u_0(x,y) u_x + v_0(x,y) u_y  + p_x ) &= f_0 \\
  \nu \Delta v -( u_0(x,y) v_x + v_0(x,y) v_y  + p_y ) &= f_1 \\
  \Delta p - \delta (u_x+v_y)                      &= f_2 
\end{align*}
with boundary conditions
\newcommand{\given}{\rm given}
\begin{align*}
   \text{wall:}&\qquad u=\given \quad v=\given, \quad p_n=\given \\
   \text{inflow:}&\qquad u=\given, \quad v=\given, \quad p=\given \\
   \text{outflow:}&\qquad u_n=\given \quad v_n=\given, \quad p=\given
\end{align*}
The damping factor $\delta$ helps to keep $u_x+v_y$ small, see the papers
 \cite{ICSSI},\cite{BCSSI} for more details on discretizing the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations.

The system of equations is built using coefficient matrices, see the operator
documentation, available from the Overture home page, for other examples.
The program solves the equations on a square with an inflow boundary on the left,
an outflow boundary on the right and no-slip walls on the top and bottom.
The forcing functions $f_0$, $f_1$ and $f_2$ are chosen so that the exact solution
is known. This known solution is a quadratic polynomial for which the method should
give the exact answer. Indeed if you run this example you should see that the
computed errors are ``zero'' (round off level).

\section{Getting Started with CompositeGrid's}

A {\tt CompositeGrid} is a class that holds an overlapping grid. An
overlapping grid can be created with the interactive grid generation program
{\tt ogen}, and saved in a data-base (HDF) file. Application programs such
as the examples that follow can easily read the data-base file to create 
an overlapping grid.


\subsection{Example 1: CompositeGrid's and MappedGrid's}\index{example1}
\index{CompositeGrid!example}

Here is an example of how to create a CompositeGrid from 
a data base file created by the interactive grid generation program {\tt ogen}.

(file {\tt Overture/primer/example1.C})
{\footnotesize
\listinginput[1]{1}{\homeHenshaw/Overture/primer/example1.C}
}
We first read in a {\tt CompositeGrid} from the data base file that was created
with {\tt ogen}.
We then loop over the component grids
and print out some variables.
A component grid is actually a ``MappedGrid'', as shown
in the example. A {\tt MappedGrid} is so named since it contains
a mapping function. See sections \ref{sec:MappedGrid} and \ref{sec:CompositeGrid}
for  a brief description of the variables that are contained 
in a {\tt MappedGrid} and a {\tt CompositeGrid}.

When I run this example the program will prompt for the name of the
overlapping grid data base file, and I will enter the name of the file
that I created with {\tt ogen}, for example {\tt \cgsh/square5.hdf}.

The file {\tt Overture/primer/gridQuery.C} is a program that can be used to read in
and display various information about a CompositeGrid.
\index{CompositeGrid!display interactively with gridQuery}\index{gridQuery}.

  \caption{Class diagram for a MappedGrid}\label{fig:mappedGrid}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\vfill\eject
\subsection{Example 2: grid functions}\index{example2}
\index{CompositeGridFunction!example}

In the next example we introduce the notion of a grid function.
A ``realCompositeGridFunction'' is a discrete function that lives
on the grid points (or cell centres or faces)
of a CompositeGrid~\cite{GF}. A {\tt realCompositeGridFunction}
contains a list of ``realMappedGridFunctions'', one {\tt realMappedGridFunction}
for each component grid. 

(file {\tt Overture/primer/example2.C})
{\footnotesize
\listinginput[1]{1}{\homeHenshaw/Overture/primer/example2.C}
}
A ``realCompositeGridFunction will either
be a grid function of ``floats'' or a grid function of ``doubles''
depending on a compiler flag. 
In the above example we use the function {\tt getIndex} to
define the Index objects {\tt I1,I2,I3}
corresponding to the {\tt indexRange} -- i.e. the interior
points of the grid. The interior points on each
component grid of the grid function {\tt u} are given values
equal to $sin(x) cos(y)$. The object {\tt u[grid]} is a 
``realMappedGridFunction''. This object is derived from an
A++ array and thus inherits all the functionality of an
A++ array.

\end{figure}

\vfill\eject
\subsection{Example 3: interpolation}\index{example3}
\index{interpolation!example}

In the next example we show how to interpolate a grid function, i.e. how to
obtain the values at the interpolation points given the values at all other
points. In order to interpolate you must first create an ``Interpolant''
object. This object knows how to interpolate grid functions on a 
given CompositeGrid. 

(file {\tt Overture/primer/example3.C})
{\footnotesize
\listinginput[1]{1}{\homeHenshaw/Overture/primer/example3.C}
}
In this example we use the {\tt mask} array to selectively assign 
the grid points. The mask array is positive for discretization points,
negative for interpolation points and zero for unused points.
After interpolation the values at points with {\tt mask<0} will 
have been assigned.
As shown in the example there are two ways to interpolate.
The second way, {\tt u.interpolate()} may seem a bit mysterious since
why should the grid function know about the Interpolant? The answer
is that when the Interpolant is made it tells the CompositeGrid
that it exists. The grid function checks with the CompositeGrid that
it is associated with to see if an Interpolant has been made and
if so it uses it.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\vfill\eject
\subsection{Example 4: show files}\index{example4}
\index{show file!example}

Grid functions can be saved in a ``show file'' and later displayed
with plotStuff (in the Overture/bin directory). In this example we show how to make a show file.
More work has to be done on show files so some of the syntax
may change in the future.

(file {\tt Overture/primer/example4.C})
{\footnotesize
\listinginput[1]{1}{\primer/example4.C}
}
This example demonstrates a few other features of grid functions such
as declaring a grid function with more than one component and linking
one grid function to another.

Use plotStuff to display the results from this example, ``plotStuff fileName.show''
where ``fileName.show'' was the name chosen for the showfile when the program was run.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\vfill\eject
\subsection{Example 5: Differentiating grid functions}\index{example5}
\index{differentiation!of a grid function, example}

The {\tt \MGO} and {\tt \CGO} classes can be used
can be used to compute spatial
derivatives of grid functions and to apply boundary conditions.
In this example we show how to differentiate grid functions
to second or fourth-order accuracy.

(file {\tt Overture/primer/example5.C})
{\footnotesize
\listinginput[1]{1}{\primer/example5.C}
}
In this example we create a {\tt \CGO} object and associate
it with a {\tt CompositeGrid}. We compute the x-derivative of
a {\tt realCompositeGridFunction} and of 
{\tt realMappedGridFunction}'s.
The member
function ``x'' in the grid function returns the
x derivative of the grid function as a new grid function. 
It uses the derivative
defined in the {\tt \CGO} object which in turn uses a {\tt \MGO} object
to compute the derivatives of a {\MGF}. The default {\tt \MGO} object
used by a {\tt \CGO} can be changed.
Note that by default the derivative of a {\tt realCompositeGridFunction} 
is only computed at interior and boundary points (indexRange). Thus to
access (make a view) of the derivative values of the grid function {\tt u.x()} 
at the Index's {\tt (I1,I2,I3)}
it is necessary to say {\tt u.x()(I1,I2,I3)}. On the other hand the statement
{\tt u.x(I1,I2,I3)} will evaluate the derivatives on the points
defined by {\tt (I1,I2,I3)}, but will return a grid function that is dimensioned
for the entire grid. Thus in general on could say {\tt u.x(I1,I2,I3)(J1,J2,J3)}
to evaluate the derivatives at points {\tt (I1,I2,I3)} but to use (take a view)
of the grid function at the Index's {\tt (J1,J2,J3)}. 

The {\tt \MGO~} and {\tt \CGO} classes are described in more detail in the
grid function documentation.

\subsection{Example 6: Solving a simple PDE using Differential and Boundary operators}\index{example6}
\index{PDE!on a CompositeGrid, example}

In this example we solve the convection-diffusion equation
\[
   {\partial u \over \partial t} 
 + a {\partial u \over \partial x} 
 + b {\partial u \over \partial y} 
 = \nu ( {\partial^2 u \over \partial x^2} 
        + {\partial^2 u \over \partial y^2}  )
\]
with a simple time stepping method (forward Euler)
The solutions at different time steps are saved in a show
file. 
% The {\tt DifferentialAndBoundaryOperators} class
% will be described in more detail in the next section.

(file {\tt Overture/primer/example6.C})
{\footnotesize
\listinginput[1]{1}{\primer/example6.C}
}
To run this example:
\begin{itemize}
  \item First create an overlapping grid. For example, from the {\tt Overture/sampleGrids} directory
     type {\tt ../bin/ogen noplot cic.cmd} to create the grid {\tt cic.hdf} using
      the command file {\tt cic.cmd}.
  \item Run {\tt example6}. Enter {\tt cic.hdf} as the overlapping grid to use
     and {\tt primer.show} as the name of the output ``show'' file.
  \item Look at the results by typing {\tt ../bin/plotStuff primer.show}.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Note} that a fixed time step is used in this example and that
the time step may not be small enough to keep the method stable if you
use a different grid from {\tt cic.hdf}.

Currently, computing derivatives in this way will not be so
efficient. An efficient way to compute derivatives is described
in section (\ref{efficient}) and in the grid function documentation.

In this example we chose the boundary conditions to be dirichlet
on all sides of all grids. By default the values at dirichet
boundaries are set to zero. Boundary conditions can be defined

If you want to solve the problem with fourth-order accuracy you can 
un-comment the two lines indicated in example6.C. You will need to use an
overlapping grid created for fourth order (such as {\tt cic.4.cmd}) and
you will need to decrease the time step {\tt dt} by a factor of 4 or so(?).

\subsection{Example 7: Solving Poisson's equation with Oges}\index{example7}
\index{PDE!Poisson equation, example}

In this example we solve Poisson's equation in 2 or 3D,
$$
   {\partial^2 u \over \partial x^2} 
 + {\partial^2 u \over \partial y^2} 
 + {\partial^2 u \over \partial z^2} 
= f ~~~~\mbox{for~} \xv \in \Omega
$$
with Dirichlet boundary conditions
$$
    u=0 ~~~~\mbox{for~} \xv \in \partial\Omega
$$
(file {\tt Overture/primer/example7.C})
{\footnotesize
\listinginput[1]{1}{\primer/example7.C}
}
We use the {\tt Oges} (Overlapping grid equation solver)
class to use a sparse matrix solver to solve the problem.
We use the differential operators in the {\tt \CGO} class
to define coefficients of the Laplacian operator and
the coefficients for the boundary condition.
By default the {\tt Oges} solver will use the Yale
sparse matrix solver. The first time the problem
is solved the matrix will be factored. Subsequent calls
to solve with different right-hand-sides will only 
involve a back-substitution. See the {\tt Oges} 
documentation for further details on the many 
available options.

If instead of the Laplacian operator we wanted to define
some other operator, say,
$$
   2{\partial^2 u \over \partial x^2} 
 +  {\partial^2 u \over \partial y^2} 
 + 3{\partial u \over \partial x} 
$$
then we could have used the statement
{\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
    coeff=2.*u.xxCoefficients()+u.yyCoefficients()+3.*u.xCoefficients(();
\end{verbatim}
}

\subsection{Example 8: Interactive plotting with PlotStuff}\index{example8}
\index{PlotStuff!example}

 In this example we show how to plot ``stuff'' interactively from a
program using the {\tt PlotStuff} class. These plotting routines
are based on OpenGL and can run on many platforms. Currently 
on Sun's I use Brian Paul's Mesa library which is a public domain implementation of
OpenGL that runs under X-windows.
More information about plotting can be found in the document
\ogshow/PlotStuff.tex.

Here is an example code that uses the {\tt PlotStuff} class to plot
various objects from the Overture class
(file {\tt Overture/primer/example8.C})
{\footnotesize
\listinginput[1]{1}{\primer/example8.C}
}
When the example is run
a window will pop up. To see the menus, put the cursor over the window and
press the right mouse button. 
Choosing {\bf contour}, for example, will
cause the {\tt contour} function to be called. Now choose {\bf plot} to
display the contour/surface plot. Other menu items allow one to change
features of the plot. 
Buttons on the window allow one to shift rotate and zoom the plot.
The left mouse button can be used to zoom using a rubber-band box.

This example show how to save information in a data base file. This could

directory structure within the data base file. See the data base documentation
for further details.


See also the documentation on ShowFileReader in the Ogshow documentation
for how to read grids and grid functions from a show file. This would
be another way to get initial conditions for a solver.

% \index{differentiation}{efficient computation, example}
% 
% An efficient method for computing derivatives is shown in this
% example. See also the example for the wave equation~(\ref{sec:wave}) for
% a perhaps even more efficient approach.
% 
% One must first indicate how many derivatives will be
% evaluated, {\tt setNumberOfDerivativesToEvaluate}, and which
% derivatives should be evaluated, {\tt setDerivativeType}, and also
% supply A++ arrays to hold the results in ({\tt uvx,uvy,uvxx,uvyy}).
% These arrays will automatically be made large enough to hold the
% results if they are not already large enough.  The arrays are not,
% however, made smaller if they are too big. Thus once the arrays
% are large enough for the grid with the most grid points the arrays
% will not be redimensioned anymore. The call to {\tt
% getDerivatives} will evaluate all the derivatives all at once (thus
% saving computations) and place the results in the user supplied arrays
% (thus saving memory allocation overhead).

\subsection{Example: 2D Wave equation (optimised for performance and memory usage)}\label{sec:wave}
\index{wave equation, example}
\index{PDE!wave equation, example} \index{efficient computation, example}


This example shows how to solve the 2D wave equation,
\[
      u_{tt} - c^2 \Delta u = 0 ~.
\]
This example has been optimised for performance and memory usage.
Rectangular grids especially, are treated in an efficent manner.

We discretize this second order equation in time using a second-order
centered difference,
\[
    { u^{n+1}_i - 2 u^n_i + u^{n-1}_i \over \Delta t^2 }  - c^2 \Delta_h u^n_i =0 ~,
\]
where the superscript $n$ denotes the time level.
We use either a 2nd order or 4th order discretization in space. We only interpolate assuming
a second-order scheme so formally the method is not fourth-order.

The above scheme has no dissipation. To smooth out numerical oscillations an artificial
dissipation term has been added of the form $h^4 \partial_t u_{xxxx}$,
\[
  { u^{n+1}_i - 2 u^n_i + u^{n-1}_i \over \Delta t^2 }  - c^2 \Delta_h u^n_i +
       -C~ h^4(D_+D_-)^2 (u^n-u^{n-1})=0
\]

To allow the use of a fourth-order difference approximation on an overlapping grid
that is only built for a stencil that is $3\times3$ we use the {\tt extrapolateInterpolationNeighbours}
boundary condition to extrapolate values at the normally unused points next to interpolation points.
With these values defined we can apply a fourth order difference at all interior points.

See file {\tt Overture/primer/wave.C}.

% In this example the grid had about $6.3$ million grids points of which $5\times10^5$ points were
% on the curvlinear grids. Running with the `noplot' option required about $220M$ of memory.

This example shows how to move a component grid and recompute the
overlapping grid. The second component grid will be rotated.

You might try running this example with the grid {\tt sis.hdf} which
is an overlapping grid for a square inside a square. When the 
example runs a window will pop up and a grid will be shown. Choose
the menu item {\tt erase and exit} (right mouse button) to continue.

The results will also be saved in a show file, called ``move1.show''.

\subsection{Example: Time dependent adaptive mesh refinement solver: amrh}
\index{adaptive grids!example}

The file {\tt Overture/primer/amrh.C} solves a convection diffusion equation
using adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). The equation
\[
    u_t + a u_x + b u_y = \nu \Delta u
\]
is advanced with a fouth-order accurate Runge-Kutta time stepping algorithm.
Every few steps a new AMR grid is computed, based on an estimate of the error.
The solution must then be interpolated from the old AMR grid to the new AMR grid.
For simplicity, a single time step is used on all grids.
The AMR algorithm is implemented with the help of the following classes
\begin{description}
  \item[ErrorEstimator] : class used to compute error estimates.
  \item[Regrid] : class used to build a new AMR grid.
  \item[InterpolateRefinements] : used to 
     \begin{itemize}
        \item interpolate from one AMR grid to a second AMR grid, 
        \item interpolate ghost-boundaries of refinement grids
        \item interpolate coarse grid ppoints that are hidden by refinement grids.
     \end{itemize}
     This class in turn uses the {\bf Interpolate} class which knows how to interpolate
     refinement patch points from a coarser grid.
\end{description}

\subsection{Example: Multigrid Overlapping Grids}
\index{multigrid!example}

This example shows how to manipulate an overlapping grid that has more than
one multigrid level. The overlapping grid should be created with more than one 
multigrid level as shown for example in the {\tt cicmg.cmd} command file presented
in the {\tt ogen} grid generator documentation.
% (file {\tt Overture/primer/cicmg.cmd})
% {\footnotesize
% \listinginput[1]{1}{\primer/cicmg.cmd}

The following program reads in the overlapping grid. It then plots the overlapping grids
at the different levels (each multigrid level is a valid {\tt CompositeGrid}).
Next a grid function is built and the different multigrid levels of the grid function
are assigned and plotted.

\subsection{Example: Solving elliptic problems on each multigrid level}

This example shows how to solve an elliptic problem on each multigrid level of an overlapping
grid. The example also shows how to access the matrix coefficients and compute
the residual. The overlapping grid should be created with more than one 
multigrid level as shown for example in the {\tt cicmg.cmd} command file (see the previous section).


The following program reads in the overlapping grid. 
Grid functions are built on the multigrid overlapping grid to hold the solution, right-hand-side
and the coefficient matrix. Since the {\tt CompositeGridOperators} and the sparse solver
class {\tt Oges} do not know about multigrid levels it is necessary to explicitly build these objects
for each level. For each multigrid level we build a coefficient matrix and solve a problem.
The errors are printed.

\section{Single versus double precision}
\index{double precision, compiling for}

Overture is designed so that one writes a single code that can be used in
either single or double precision. The types {\tt real}, {\tt realMappedGridFunction},
{\tt realCompositeGridFunction} etc. are either {\tt float} or {\tt double} depending on
whether the Overture library has been built with the double precision option.
 Note that the Overture
library must be entirely recompiled for double precision. Thus the steps to take to
run in {\bf double precision} are
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Build the Overture library in double precision.
  \item remake any overlapping grids with the new double precision version of the grid generator.
\end{enumerate}
Thus one would never explicitly create a {\tt doubleMappedGridFunction} (except in very special
cases).
The file {\tt Overture/include/OvertureDefine.h} will define the macro {\tt OV\_USE\_DOUBLE} if
Overture has been compiled in double precision.

\section{Makefile's and .cshrc files}

When Overture is installed using the {\tt Overture/configure} script {\tt Makefile}'s are
build in sub-directories of Overture. You can copy the {\tt Makefile} from the 
{\tt Overture/primer} directory to use as a starting point for making other applications.

The Overture {\tt Makefile}'s require a number of environmental variables to be 
defined so that it knows where
to find various libraries. 
Here are some example {\tt .cshrc} files that could be used to define these environmental
variables.

\noindent
{\bf NOTE} that if you are making (i.e. installing) Overture (as opposed to just using it) you must explicitly 
define the locations of OpenGL, HDF and APlusPlus (rather than using
the relative paths given below).

\noindent
{\bf Note:} If you have made the {\bf double precision} version of Overture then you should add {\tt -DDOUBLE}
to the {\tt CCFLAGS} definitions in the Makefiles below as in {\tt CCFLAGS= -DDOUBLE -O ...}
